!!! Important
    The EUC related samples stored in the [VMware EUC Samples Exchange](https://code.vmware.com/vmware-samples) have been migrated to the [Omnissa euc-samples GitHub repository](https://github.com/euc-oss/euc-samples) and are organised according to Platform. Some samples may no longer be present or be located in a different location. Please be patient as we work to provide you with a new format. Alternatively, feel free to contribute your samples to [euc-samples](https://github.com/euc-oss/euc-samples) directly.
    Any samples residing within [euc-samples](https://github.com/euc-oss/euc-samples) will be indexed on a 24 hour basis and displayed in the corresponding section linked below.

> Disclaimer: All sample content and code in Sample Exchange is licensed to you by the sample's author. Omnissa does not guarantee the samples; they are provided "AS IS". Use of this site is subject to the Omnissa Community Terms of Use.

Browse and download code samples from Omnissa as well as code samples contributed by the Omnissa community. This project is intended for the community and Omnissa to share commonly used code snippets, sample apps, scripts and sensors that can aid Workspace ONE and Horizon administrators. 

Some examples of items found in this repository are:

* Custom XML Profile Payloads
* Script content for Custom Attributes
* Scripts to be leveraged via WS1 Scripts (Bash/shell, Python, Powershell, Batch, etc)
* Scripts to assist with automation against the various REST API's
* Sample Apps
* Workspace ONE Intelligence Dashboards
* Application deployment scripts and how-to guides
* Markdown Documents describing suggested best practices or procedures that may be outside the realm of typical documentation

Each product has an index page that provides the name, summary and link to the provided samples. The UEM-Samples index also includes Sensor and Scripts within the [UEM-Samples/Scripts](https://github.com/euc-oss/euc-samples/tree/main/UEM-Samples/Scripts) and [UEM-Samples/Sensors](https://github.com/euc-oss/euc-samples/tree/main/UEM-Samples/Sensors) folders respectively.
