## Technical Capabilities

### Find the Right Technical Approach for Integrating Your App With Workspace ONE

There are multiple technical approaches you can use to securely integrate apps with Workspace ONE. Most commonly, developers use a combination of technical approaches to meet the desired outcome based on whether they are creating Android, iOS, or web-native apps.

<div class="grid" markdown>

=== "Identity Manager"
    The Identity Manager component of Workspace ONE acts as a user store, a user catalog and Single Sign On (SSO) hub for your organization. Identity Managerâ€™s APIs shorten app development time by providing consumable authentication and SSO capabilities. The REST APIs also allow your app to manage various objects within your organization: applications, entitlements, users and groups. <table width: 100%>  <thead>  <tr>  <th>Development Effort</th>  <th>Supported App Types</th>  </tr>  </thead>  <tr>  <td><span style="color:orange">**Medium**</span></td>  <td><span style="color:red">:material-lock-open-variant:</span>    <span style="color:green">:material-lock:</span></td>  </tr>  <tr>  <td>**Primary Use Case:**&ensp; Giving end users easy authentication into your application</td>  <td>**Deployment:** &ensp; :simple-apple:  :simple-android:  :simple-windows:  :simple-macos:</td>  </tr>  </table>

=== "App Wrapping"
    App Wrapping identifies specific app functions and replaces them with calls to the AirWatch SDK. This allows for a subset of AirWatch SDK capabilities to be added to an app without requiring any developer involvement. App Wrapping is only compatible with internal apps using approved development platforms, coding practices and libraries. <table width: 100%>  <thead>  <tr>  <th>Development Effort</th>  <th>Supported App Types</th>  </tr>  </thead>  <tr>  <td><span style="color:orange">**Medium**</span></td>  <td><span style="color:red">:material-lock-open-variant:</span>    <span style="color:green">:material-lock:</span></td>  </tr>  <tr>  <td>**Primary Use Case:** &ensp; Provides a subset of SDK functionality. Only recommended for tactical deployments</td>  <td>**Deployment:**  &ensp; :simple-apple:  :simple-android:  :simple-windows:  :simple-macos: <br>**Note:** Not compatible with Android for Work enrolled devices.</td>  </tr>  </table>

=== "AppConfig.org"
    The AppConfig Community is a collection of industry-leading EMM solution providers and app developers that are making it simpler for developers to use native platform APIs to configure and secure apps in the enterprise. <table width: 100%>  <thead>  <tr>  <th>Development Effort</th>  <th>Supported App Types</th>  </tr>  </thead>  <tr>  <td><span style="color:green">**Low**</span></td>  <td><span style="color:red">:material-lock-open-variant:</span>    <span style="color:green">:material-lock:</span></td>  </tr>  <tr>  <td>**Primary Use Case:**  &ensp; An open and native approach ideal for most common use cases></td>  <td>**Deployment:**  &ensp; :simple-apple:  :simple-android:  :simple-windows:  :simple-macos: <br>**Note:** Android for Work enrolled devices only.</td>  </tr>  </table>

=== "AirWatch SDK"
    The SDK code library from AirWatch can be used to enable additional app config and security capabilities that may not yet be available natively as part of the AppConfig Community. Certain use cases such as granular analytics can be provided through a deeper integration with the SDK. 
    <table width: 100%>  <thead>  <tr>  <th>Development Effort</th>  <th>Supported App Types</th>  </tr>  </thead>  <tr>  <td><span style="color:orange">**Medium**</span></td>  <td><span style="color:red">:material-lock-open-variant:</span>    <span style="color:green">:material-lock:</span></td>  </tr>  <tr>  <td>**Primary Use Case:** &ensp; Code library for use cases requiring deeper integration</td>  <td>**Deployment:** &ensp; :simple-apple:  :simple-android:  :simple-windows:  :simple-macos:</td>  </tr>  </table>
