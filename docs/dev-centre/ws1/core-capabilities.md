## App Configuration

An app may require seed information for initial configuration or updated configurations throughout the course of its lifecycle.

For example, the backend server URL of an application can be seeded to the application during install so the app can auto-configure with minimal user input. With the Workspace ONE platform, you can create seamless setup flows by provisioning app config values such as server, port and domain, down to your app. Improve user experience by eliminating first time setup steps and dynamically change settings in your app with over the air updates.

| Technical Approaches | Implementation Summary | Supported Platforms |
|:--- |:--- |:---:|
| **AppConfig.org** | The recommended approach for implementing app configuration is through the use of the AppConfig Community best practices of Managed Configurations for iOS and App Restrictions for Android. Detailed technical documentation is available at AppConfig.org.<br>- Use the AppConfig Community practice of using iOS managed configs or Android app restrictions to deliver custom configuration values to your app.<br>- AirWatch will use the platform MDM protocol to deliver these configuration values to NSUserDefault or RestrictionsManager upon installation of your app.<br>- Requires enrollment in MDM.<br>- Requires iOS 7+ or Android 5.0+ with Android for Work Device. | :simple-apple:  :simple-android: |
| **Airwatch SDK** | An alternative approach to app config is through the integration of the AirWatch SDK to receive custom configurations from your AirWatch server.<br>- Integrate the AirWatch SDK into your app and configure an SDK profile with a custom payload containing your configuration values and assign it to your app.<br>- Initialize the SDK and use the appropriate method calls to retrieve the custom settings containing your configuration values.<br>- Requires coding and device entry in AirWatch system, no MDM required. | :simple-android: |

## App Passcode

For security reasons, enterprises may want to prevent continuous access to an app without periodic authentication.

An app passcode can ensure the app is only accessible to the entitled user and that the user identity is maintained over time. A biometric, such as TouchID, can typically be implemented as a layer above the PIN code to optimize the user experience.

| Technical Approaches | Implementation Summary | Supported Platforms |
|:--- |:--- |:---:|
| **Airwatch SDK** | - Integrate the AirWatch SDK for iOS and Android into your application.<br>- Configure the SDK profile policy for your application to enforce a passcode.<br>- The SDK will automatically display the “View Controllers & Activities” to secure your app with a passcode.<br>- Requires coding and device entry in AirWatch system, no MDM required. | :simple-android: |
| **AppConfig.org** | - Reference the sample code and documentation available at AppConfig.org<br>- Use the sample code as a starting point for the PIN code UI, and customize as needed<br>- Implement an app configuration in order to have the MDM server set the PIN code policy<br>- Requires device enrollment on iOS, and Android for Work on Android | :simple-apple:  :simple-android: |
| **App Wrapping** | - Develop and compile your application.<br>- Verify that the app is only using an approved MADP platform and coding techniques<br>- Run the compiled binary through the AirWatch application wrapping cloud engine.<br>- Assign a wrapping profile to your application with a passcode policy.<br>- Requires neither coding nor MDM, only device entry in AirWatch system. | :simple-android: |

## App Tunneling

An application may require access to web services residing behind a corporate firewall.

A traditional full device VPN solution is not adequate due to manual steps required to enable the VPN on the device, and the security exposure by allowing personal apps the same access to the VPN as corporate apps. A more secure, seamless, targeted solution is required to allow only certain applications restricted access to certain intranet endpoints.

| Technical Approaches | Implementation Summary | Supported Platforms |
|:--- |:--- |:---:|
| **AppConfig.org** | - Use the AppConfig practice of configuring a Per-App VPN profile through your MDM console for your application.<br>- All network traffic specific to the whitelisted applications defined in the profile will be redirected through the Tunnel proxy.<br>- Requires iOS 7+ / Android 5.0+. (Android 4.x on roadmap)<br>- Requires AirWatch Tunnel app to be present on device and the AirWatch Tunnel Server<br>- Requires enrollment into MDM.<br>- Requires no coding. | :simple-apple:  :simple-android: |
| **Airwatch SDK** | - Integrate the AirWatch SDK into your application and configure a SDK profile with Tunneling enabled and assign it to your application.<br>- Ensure the networking classes and methods used by your applications are supported in the AirWatch SDK guide.<br>- The SDK will redirect your app network traffic through a supported proxy to reach your targeted backend.<br>- Requires coding and device entry in AirWatch system, no MDM required. | :simple-apple:  :simple-android: |

## Encryption

For apps with sensitive data or files, you may want to encrypt the persisted contents of the app in case the file system is compromised.

Extraction of the persistent storage will only expose encryption ciphertext as opposed to the readable data.

| Technical Approaches | Implementation Summary | Supported Platforms |
|:--- |:--- |:---:|
| **AppConfig.org** | The recommended approach is to use the AppConfig Community best practices for enforcing device passcodes on iOS devices to ensure DAR encryption.On Android,apply an MDM policy to enforce encryption.<br>- For iOS, ensure a device passcode is set on the device through a MDM passcode policy. By setting a device-level passcode, the OS will encrypt all data on the device using the device PIN entry.<br>- For Android, configure an MDM policy to enforce device encryption.<br>- Requires no coding | :simple-apple:  :simple-android: |
| **Airwatch SDK** | One alternative approach for Android is to use the AirWatch SDK’s encryption read / write methods to encrypt your app data<br>- The SDK provides data IO methods that can take in a data argument and return an encrypted cipher text and vice versa.<br>- Requires coding and device entry in AirWatch system, no MDM required. | :simple-android: |
| **App Wrapping** | Another alternative approach for Android devices is to leverage AirWatch App Wrapping.<br>- Enable the encryption capability and wrap the app.<br>- Verify that the app is only using an approved MADP platform and coding techniques. | :simple-android: |

## Single Sign On Certificate Authentication

For security reasons, enterprises may require authentication for their API endpoints and websites, SSO via Certificates allows a developer to leverage enrollment credentials to handle the authentication without prompting the end user of the app.

Integrated Authentication is an SDK feature that allows a developer to achieve Single Sign On for their app's web requests. The user's client certificates are automatically passed to an endpoint that challenges for Certificate authentication. By doing so, it is no longer necessary for the developer to manually handle the authentication for an endpoint or prompt a user for credentials.

| Technical Approaches | Implementation Summary | Supported Platforms |

## Single Sign On OpenID Connect

End users want easy access to their apps and data, and organizations want to avoid the security risks and helpdesk support tickets that come from different passwords and authentication logic for different apps. You can support both groups while decreasing the time it takes to develop apps by relying on Workspace ONE for Single Sign On (SSO). When an end user visits your app, the app can redirect the user to Workspace ONE for authentication.

OpenID Connect (OIDC) SSO relies on JSON-based communication between your app and Workspace ONE. It is often the preferred SSO method of mobile developers and is also used in many new web apps. OIDC allows an end user with a browser to log into an Identity Provider (IdP) such as Workspace ONE.

| Technical Approaches | Implementation Summary | Supported Platforms |
|:--- |:--- |:---:|
| **Identity Manager** | Take advantage of one of the many OIDC libraries to make implementation easier. <br>- Register your app as an OIDC client in Workspace ONE using the Identity Manager console. <br>- Use browser redirects to transfer your user to Workspace ONE for authentication. <br>- Requires some coding. <br>- Web app, native app, or other app. | :simple-apple:  :simple-android:  :simple-windows:  :simple-macos: |
