- name: App Import
  description: The platform provisions two fileshares in the customer subscription
    for each Microsoft Azure pod onboarded, as follows - Staging is where application
    packages that need to be imported are staged and is also a location from which
    application packages can be delivered to end users.Delivery is used solely for
    delivering application packages to end users
- name: AppPackages
  description: Each Package stores one or more Programs required for the Application
    to run. A single Package can be delivered to multiple computers and users.For
    the packaging process, you must select a computer as the packaging machine and
    then build the Package on the packaging machine where the programs you want to
    include in the Package are installed. You can provide additional Package metadata
    on the packaging machine such as name of the Packager and any additional notes
    about the Package.
- name: AppVersions
  description: 'AppVersion is the particular version of software installed/captured
    in a given capture session. As part of the Cloud native capture only one AppVersion
    can be part of a Package. AppVersion was called in the past as "App Bundle" in
    the 3.x terminology. This is uniquely identified by a uuid which is generated
    during the capture session. With application package merge, it is possible to
    have the same AppVersion in multiple packages and also that single Package can
    have more than one AppVersion contained in it. Eg: "Microsoft Office 2013 sp1"
    can be the application version which can be captured under a virtual application
    named "Microsoft Office", and this version can reside on a package "Microsoft_Office_2013_SP1_Clean.vhd"'
- name: Applications
  description: ' Application is the Virtual Application container which will be created
    by the administrator to store the different application packages captured or imported
    to be stored under. This will act as a grouping for different versions of the
    same software, so that the administrator can mark one of the application versions
    using a marker and that can be used in an assignment. Eg: "Microsoft Office" will
    be created as an application which is the virtual application container which
    will contain "Microsoft Office 2013 sp1" as an application version under it, "Microsoft_Office_2013_SP1_Clean.vhd"
    can be the application package containing the particular application version'

  description: 'Image preferences are used when working with vCenter-based providers
    that offer image capacity. They provide a convenient way to set and reuse image
    placement parameters (example: datacenter, datastore, cluster, resource pool,
    and network) which is especially helpful in environments with multiple vCenters.
    The client of the API should be aware of the infrastructure capabilities (such
    as GPU support and other workload characteristics for datastore) beforehand to
    place the images appropriately.'

      description: 'Schema Representation for AppVersion. AppVersion is the particular
        version of software installed/captured in a given capture session. As part
        of the Cloud native capture only one AppVersion can be part of a Package.
        AppVersion was called in the past as "App Bundle" in the 3.x terminology.
        This is uniquely identified by a uuid which is generated during the capture
        session. With application package merge, it is possible to have the same AppVersion
        in multiple packages and also that single Package can have more than one AppVersion
        contained in it. Eg: "Microsoft Office 2013 sp1" can be the application version
        which can be captured under a virtual application named "Microsoft Office",
        and this version can reside on a package "Microsoft_Office_2013_SP1_Clean.vhd"
